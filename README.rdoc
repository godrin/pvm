== Ruby / PVM
PVM stands for "parallel virtual machine".
The aim of this project is a virtual machine that's able to handle:
* massive parallel threads
* complete control of all resources (memory, cpu time, network traffic)
* a small subset of the ruby-stdlib, that supports everything you need for a networking application
